You can write programs that use Hopsworks in any [Python, Spark, PySpark, or Flink environment](../../user_guides/integrations/index.md). You can also SQL queries in DBT jobs to compute features in external data warehouses - these are external feature groups in Hopsworks.

There is REST API for Hopsworks that can be used with a valid API key, generated in Hopsworks. However, it is often easier to develop your programs against SDKs available in Python and Java/Scala for HSFS, in Python for HSML, and in Python for the Hopsworks API.
